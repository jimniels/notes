# [40 things I have learned being a creative entrepreneur](https://newsletters.feedbinusercontent.com/d30/d309efabf68f687a402b02436fd3819d2815b960.html)

To celebrate his 40th birthday, Michael Flarup put together a list of 40 things he’s learned. A lot resonated with my own experience and reflects the same kind of advice I would give. Just a few:

> Stop chasing perfect. Go for good and iterate

> Try not to please everyone with the things you make. It’s your work. Make it reflect your taste.

> Creative work doesn’t follow a straight line from not-good to good.

> You become what you work on. The world has a tendency to feed you more of what you put into it, so make sure it’s something you like.

> Showing up everyday and moving the ball, even just a little, almost always wins out over bursts of burning the midnight oil. 

> Find your sources of energy and wield them as tools.
